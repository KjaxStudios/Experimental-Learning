# Experimental-Learning
Just give tips and try out new code and ask for help from others ;D
Yeah just ask others if you need any help. I could really use some help myself!
this wholde github interface is killing me! anyway We will b using github to share code as we Team build a video game
firstoff we need at least 4 members.
2 programmers
1 scene creator
1 character and object designer
this will ensure that everybody gets to help with somehitng. i think unity 3d could be a good software but takes time to learn
the coding is also different but its very easy to set up scenes.
Vs 2013 is sorta...
anyway just enjoy and compare code with others!
we need a better company name also
Enjoy!
# pragma-strict
var health = float: 10.0

function damage();
findobjectwithtag("bullet")

if collision(collide Gamobject = Bullet)
health;--
function die();
if dead (health < 0){
this.destroy
}
just a simple code that will kill the player when his health is less than 0.
it might not all be correct but its a good bit of it. its used by unity 3d and is not pure javescript.
anyways what should our first game be?
need help!

#python language 
 hello! 
 some of us.(mostly me) have been wondering about a programming language called python. 
 yes python. sounds scary but its just abotu the same as javascript. 
 simple and fun. 
 # javascript 
 Really imple language. just amke a function and tell it what the functin does to a variable (var) 
 #C#  
 father of all prgrmming. first language we ever had. 
 we dont require you to know it but if you want to  
 it could be an interesting topic. 
 #wings 3d vs. blender 
 wings3d adn blender are both very useful 33d modeling tools 
 we will probablhy be using them for most character dsining.(of course somebody comes up with something better) 
 but which is better? 
 they both get the job done. 
 neither of them faster than the other but they will do 
 what they need to. 
 i recommend wings3d its a lot easier to use. 
 blenders interface is just really not going to do it 
 its just not. when you open it up the first thing that comes across your 
 mind is "what on earth are all these buttons for?!!" 
 #other languages for programming 
 torque 
html 
 .net 
 # scene building 
 Unity 3D is by far the esiest tool for scene building. 
 very simple click and drag interface as long a you can find what objects you need. 
 scripting though, can be really wierd. 
# github sharing. interfacing is soo complicated. luckily i figured out how to add new files. 
 you have to just click the + next to expiremental learning or whatever the repositories name is. 
 you could also make another repositorie. but please dont make like 20 at a time. 
 ill make a new repositorie for everygame we begin developing. 
 #We need a blog. and a new company name. 
 yes its true. our compny name might be a bit shabby. unless you think it sounds fine. 
 well host a vote. 
 and we also need a wordpress blog.Connor has one premade. i have 2. 
 located at: 
 http://gigsogames.wordpress.com/ 
 http://dondalanecommunity.wordpress.com/ 
 Connors is located at where ever. 
 # first game 
 what should our first game be? 
 we need a good scenario. something  
 that would just totally blow our minds away. 
 Connor suggests we add ingame crafting. like minecraft.  
 #hiring more members. 
 yes we need to hire as many as possile. ask them what they are good at, then assign them to the team that 
 fit them the best. 
 sorry, but unitl we release a game and it starts selling i dont think anyone would get paid. 
 #Makest Deez Gamest
 well, Game salad or Unity would work fine, if you can figure them out. but! starting from scrath is an option (C# ancient history based) or writing in BASIC (whatever the heck that might be... i think its from 1961 LOL) BUT anyways im sure we could come up with some nice free program(Hello Unity!) for making 3D and 2D games(Unity again! they also have a free version) Publishing games? Might do it on steam. But of course, they limit accounts unless you want to spend $5.00 USD!! :/ but anway yah thats about it, happy programming! or drawing! or designing! 
#thats it for now! 
 thats just about about everything! 
 we probably will have more soon on the subject.
